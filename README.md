## very cool hyprland and ags stuff idk

ok so let me start by saying i have no idea what the fuck im doing

to instal this you need GNU stow

then clone this shit and cd into it and run `stow */`

then everythin g will be done and yuo can restart ur hyperlnd

just make sure you have:

- ags

- gnome-terminal (you can change this in the hyprland config file if you hate it for whatever reason)

- sassc  (EVERYTHING GETS FUCKED UP IF YOU DONT INSTALL THIS))))))))))))

- hyprland

- neofetch

- swaylock-effects

- swappy

- grim

- slurp

- rofi

- rofi

- and a will to live


- this is rushed becuase you guys keep begging for the dotfiles

i only tested this on fedora GNOME which i installed hyprland on
# enjoy.
